# Code Coach

## Install

- Git
- Ruby 4.0.1
- Bundler 4.0.19
- GNU Make
- Docker Desktop (macOS or Windows) or Docker Engine (Linux)

## Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Start Docker and confirm `docker info` succeeds without `sudo`.
3. Run `make run` from the project directory to start local development.

### Docker permissions on Linux

If `docker info` reports permission denied while Docker is running, add your
user to the Docker Engine installation's `docker` group:

```sh
sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"
```

Adding your user to the group does not update an existing shell's permissions.
Starting or restarting Docker does not refresh them either. If you already ran
the command above, activate the membership by running these commands one at a
time in your terminal:

```sh
newgrp docker
docker info
make run
```

`newgrp docker` starts a new shell with Docker group access; run the next two
commands in that shell. Continue to `make run` only after `docker info` succeeds.
Run the application as your normal user, without `sudo`.

Alternatively, fully log out of your desktop or SSH session and log back in,
then run `docker info` and `make run`. Opening another terminal in the same
login session may still inherit the old group permissions.

The `docker` group grants root-level privileges. See Docker's official
[Linux post-installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).
